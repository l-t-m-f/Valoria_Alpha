# Valoria_Alpha
Valoria is a prototype for an action game designed by Saryat Sarwar Khan, Shivang Semwal &amp; Umang Vinay Panal in the goal of submitting for Github GameOff 2023!

# How to test the game
Due to the limit on itch.io, we are unable to share our project in due time. However, you can test the project by downloading the source code using the git-lfs software (it must be installed). The game is pretty heavy (2.9gb).
